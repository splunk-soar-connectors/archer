<p>
When configuring the CEF to Archer mapping (cef_mapping), include the following...
</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>The name of the application (e.g. Incidents)</li>
    <li>The name of the tracking ID field (e.g. Incident ID)</li>
    <li>Separate entries for each field that should go into the CEF of an artifact</li>
</ul>
</p>
When done, your mapping will take the names of Archer fields and map them into the CEF of an artifact. It should look something like the following...
</p>

<pre>
{
    "application": "Incidents",
    "tracking": "Incident ID",
    "Status": "status",
    "Category": "category",
    "Details": "details",
    "Archer field name": "CEF name"
    ...
}
</pre>
<br>
<p>Where Status, Category, Details, etc. are fields that exist in your Archer Application that you would like to import. <br>
Certain field types and attachments from Archer are not currently supported.

If a field is specified both in the cef_mapping and in the excluded fields list, the field will be excluded and not ingested.

<h3>Scheduled | Interval polling</h3>

<ul>
    <li>During scheduled | interval polling, for the first run, the app will start from the first record and will ingest a maximum of 100 records per poll. Then it remembers the last page and content id and stores it in the state file against the key 'last_page' & 'max_content_id'. For the following scheduled ingestions, it will consider the last_page stored in the state file and will ingest the next 100 records based on the provided Application.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Manual polling</h3>

<ul>
    <li>During manual polling, the app will start from the recently created record and will ingest up to the number of records specified in the 'Maximum containers' parameter.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Explanation of the <b>[User's Domain]</b> asset configuration parameter</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This asset configuration parameter affects [test connectivity] and all the other actions of the application.</li>
    <li>When the value of this asset parameter is specified, the application will consider the user specified in the asset parameter [username] as the domain user of a given domain, and all the actions will be executed with the domain user session token created while running the action.</li>
    <li>The user will be considered as a local user when the value of this parameter is not present. And if the local user attempts to change/add any of the field value(fields that expect the username value) with the domain user, then the action will fail because it requires a domain user session token to look up the domain user. And this token is generated only if the test connectivity is successfully run by the domain user.</li>
</ul>
